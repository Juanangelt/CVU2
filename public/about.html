<h1>About Me</h1>
<h2>Who I am</h2>

<h2>My history with sport</h2>
<p>After entering the summer course, a coach saw a lot of potential in me and invited me to join his team. After that, I was practicing
  I spent some time with the team, however I couldn't adapt completely since everyone already knew each other. But one great day, people began to enter
  new ones, with whom I was able to establish a friendship, and I met my two best friends.</p>

<h2>University </h2>
<p>Two years after practicing volleyball, I entered university. This would be the biggest step of my life, however, it was overshadowed by
  a bad event, the pandemic, thanks to this, my first two years were not what I expected and I felt that they delayed a lot of the learning that I could have had.
  But today I feel that I am in the best moment of learning, and I am a few months away from finishing this stage.
